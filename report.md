# Report for the current state of the project

## Introduction

This report is a summary of the current state of the project. I'll try to explain everything simply.

I tried to implement pratices from fastapis official documentation. There was a nice tutorial there. Also, I had to 
look up to the documentations of pydantic and sqlalchemy latest versions. 

Everything in api is synchronous now. Despite the lesson presented in the lecture 8 by Yaroslav Korkodinov, I decided not to use asyncronous database. I think
at this point, I would rather focus on the basics. I'll definitely try to implement asyncronous database soon.
