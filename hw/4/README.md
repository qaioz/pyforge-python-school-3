# Homework 7
## Testing

The most challenging part of our molecule data storage is the substructure search. 
Many of you have previously used `assert` function to check that it works correctly. The goal of this homework is to cover it with tests to make sure that this function works correctly. Try to use the best practices that you learned during the lesson.

**[Optional]** Write tests for other part of the business logic of our data storage.
