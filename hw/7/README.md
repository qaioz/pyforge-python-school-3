## Logging

An important part of the application's operation is logging. 
The `print` function is enough for small projects,but a good practice is to 
use the `logging` package. 
Add logging to the project so that you can understand from the logs 
what activity is happening in our application.

## Iterator

We don't always need all the molecules at once when searching. 
Sometimes we need, for example, the first 100. 
Modify the API method `List all molecules` by adding the `limit` argument to 
limit the required number of molecules in the response. 
Don't forget to remake the function into an 
iterator using the knowledge from the lecture.
